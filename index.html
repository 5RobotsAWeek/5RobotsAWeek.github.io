                <br>Studying the reasons for certain animal behavior is difficult because life is complex. However, theories about it can be tested with biomimetic robots-- robots designed to mimic the motions of organisms. In a study published in <em>Nature</em>, researchers used fish-like robots to test the theory that fish achieve hydrodynamic benefits, and therefore save energy, by swimming in pairs. Using the robots, they found optimal swimming patterns to save energy. Comparing these optimized patterns to the behavior of real fish showed that, in the experimental conditions, fish swim in an energy saving pattern about 59% of the time.<br>
