                <br>Here is a whimsical robot. German robotics company Festo has designed these robotic birds with inspiration from the real thing. The birds, called BionicSwift, use radio signals to receive flight-pattern instructions. However, their flapping and maneuvers are autonomous. Practical applications of BionicSwift are unclear, but they sure are fun to watch. <br>
