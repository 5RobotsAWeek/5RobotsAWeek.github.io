                <br>This robot is a self-solving rubik's cube, created by Takashi Kaburagi, and showcased at the 2019 Bay Area Maker Faire. As a user scrambles the cube, the robot records each motion in order to determine where all of the pieces are. From there, it uses a programmed algorithm to determine a series of steps to solve the cube (and no, it does not simply undo the user’s motion). Motors encased in the robot execute these steps, solving the cube. This is one of the slower rubik’s cube solving robots: the current record time is 0.38 seconds (see the LiveScience article linked below). However, this is not the intent of its design, and being entirely contained within the cube is pretty clever. <br>
