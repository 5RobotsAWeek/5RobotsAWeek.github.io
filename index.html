                <br>NASA’s Curiosity rover, which arrived on Mars in 2012, uses a “rocker-bogie” suspension system for its chassis. This system has six wheels and legs, with steering from the front and back wheels. On each side, the front and middle wheels are connected so that if the front wheel moves up or down as the rover drives, the middle wheel is forced in the opposite direction. This prevents the rover body from tipping significantly as it navigates uneven terrain. The rocker-bogie design was also used on the Pathfinder, Spirit, and Opportunity rovers.<br>
