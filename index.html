              <p>Plush Robots! This is another style of soft robot,designed by researchers at the Computational Robotics Lab at
                 ETH Zurich to be inexpensive and intuitive to make and use. In order to move the limbs of these bots,
                 motors (“winches”) tighten or release chords (“tendons”) running through the robot’s body.
                 The robot is controlled by a user, either by directly controlling the motors, or through the 2D modeling interface
                 demonstrated in this video. The 2D model of the robot calculates the energy from the tension of the tendon
                 and from the compression of the robot’s stuffing to find the position that minimizes the differece between them.
                 By doing this, it can predict the motion of the robot based on changes in tendon length.
                 When the modeling is used to control the robot, the program works backward from a desired end shape to find the required
                 tendon lengths to achieve that shape. From these lengths, it determines how much
                  (and in what direction) the motors need to move. The programming for these soft robots is fascinating,
                   and who doesn’t love a plush toy? <br><br>
