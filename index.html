                <br>NASA’s rotorcraft, Dragonfly, will be the first multi-rotor vehicle used for exploration beyond Earth. Dragonfly is like a large drone, with eight rotors that will allow it to fly between research sites on Titan, one of Saturn’s moons, to look for evidence of past liquid water and organic compounds -- the basic elements of life. The rotorcraft was originally planned to launch in 2026, but the launch date has been changed to 2027 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  <br>
