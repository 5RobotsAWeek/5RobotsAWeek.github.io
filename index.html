              <p>In 2018, engineers in Singapore adapted 2 industrial robotic arms to work together to assemble an Ikea chair
                in just under 9 minutes. In addition to programming ingenuity that allowed the 2 arms to work together smoothly,
                 force sensors were vital to the success of this feat. Placing the dowels in the pre-made holes requires more
                 precision than optical sensing can offer, thus, once the arm gets close, a force sensor allows the robot to
                  feel when the dowel is in the right spot. Watching this video, from PBS Newshour,
                   you can see how the arm wiggles the dowel until it fits.Though building a chair sounds trivial,
                    this method could allow more versatile robots to take over for more common single-purpose arms in industry. <br><br>
