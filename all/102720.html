                <br>Humans can recognize tons of objects on sight, instantly noting relevant similarities and
                 differences between one object and similar items. This capability has historically been
                 difficult to translate to an automated system because there is so much variability to account
                 for. But with the introduction of neural networks, programs are able to use sets of labeled
                 images to “learn” to classify camera input. This has many applications. For example, in industry this deep
                learning can help speed up the process of quality control and product identification (this application is further discussed
                in the article and video). <br>For a more in-depth discussion of the concepts behind
                neural networks, 3blue1brown’s youtube series is a wonderful resource. <a href = “https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&t=1012s”>Link to Part 1</a> <br><br>
