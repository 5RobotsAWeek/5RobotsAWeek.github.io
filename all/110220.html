                <br>These are FreeBOTs, a hybrid of modular robots (small robotic units that physically connect to each other to create a larger robot) and swarm robots (robots that each function on their own, but work as a collective whole). Their basic design is similar to that of the popular Sphero toy, but with a ferromagnetic shell and interior magnet. This allows them to not only roll along the floor, but up and around magnetic or ferromagnetic surfaces, including one another. They connect by using the internal magnet to magnetize their shells and rolling close to each other. This creates a strong magnetic connection between the bots. Check out what they can do together in this short video! <br>
