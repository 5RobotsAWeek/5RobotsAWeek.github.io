                <br>Robots are very good at precise, repetitive motions. However, responding to
                surroundings is difficult. Realtime Robotics’ Realtime Controller is the first commercially available solution to this “motion planning problem” for industrial robots. It is designed to connect directly to a wide variety of bots, and is configured with information about the robot’s range of motion and workspace. Sensor input provides continuous data about changes in the environment (such as an obstacle put in the way). The controller then analyzes 3D models of this environment to find many possible pathways from the start to the end position. From these, the
                robot controller can find and pass to the robot instructions for an optimized,
                collision-free pathway. <br>
