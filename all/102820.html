                <br>HWhen humans watch other humans perform an action, the watcher’s brain analyzes not
                 what the other person is doing but how they are doing it. A motion’s “how” is called its
                 vitality form: fast and jerky movements tend to signal rudeness and irritation, while smoother
                  and slower motions tend to be seen as calm and gentle. However, a new study published in
                  Nature shows that fast and slow motion alone do not cue us into vitality forms.
                   When a person watches a person move, part of their brain - called the dorso-central insula -
                   is responsible for processing the movement’s vitality form. Using fMRIs, researchers showed that
                    if an iCub robot, similar to the one in the video, performs an action quickly or slowly,
                    only the part of the brain used to understand what someone is doing is activated --
                     not the insula. But, if the robot exactly mimics the kinematic parameters (for example, peak
                     velocity and minimum velocity) of a human performing a motion rudely or gently, a viewer’s
                     insula will activate, and they will perceive a vitality form in the motion.
                      <br>This study helps further understanding of how humans instinctively communicate, as
                       well as suggesting that precise programming of kinematic parameters could help humanoid
                       robots and virtual avatars become more realistic.<br>
