              <p>A team at NASA is working on creating a group of robots -- “cobots” -- that can
                assemble themselves in a variety of different ways. The design for the individual
                robots is a sophisticated drone, and its flying abilities plus its ability to work
                 with the other robots allow it to navigate tough and unknown terrain.
                 This team of robots, and the concept, is called Shapeshifter, and researchers hope
                 it can someday be used for missions to Titan, one of Saturn’s moons.
                 Though the concept is still in development -- NASA’s Dragonfly, which is scheduled
                 to launch in 2026, will visit Titan first -- it is a fascinating and futuristic design. <br><br>
