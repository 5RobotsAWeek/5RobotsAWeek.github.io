              <p>Soft robotics is an emerging subfield of robotics in which actuators are made with flexible materials like
                such as silicon, rather than motors and gears.
                This allows for smoother and more versatile motion, as well as lighter-weight designs.
                Soft robots have many possible applications, from medicine to space exploration. This video,
                 from Harvard Universityâ€™s Biodesign Lab,
                discusses a robotic glove designed to aid those who have lost hand mobility.  <br>
